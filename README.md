# Campus-Recruitment-System
A Campus Recruitment System is an online management system that manages the recruitment process in an academic institution. 
This system increases efficiency in various tasks of the recruitment process by bypassing manual processing of applications. 
It will enhance the efficiency of the system by saving valuable time and efforts that go into manual processing.
We aim to build an up-and-running web-application of a Campus Recruitment System. This system will be designed to increase efficiency of various tasks that make up the recruitment process. We
want to increase consistency in the recruitment process (for eg. posting
open positions by companies/recruiters, applying to job postings by
students, displaying a dashboard for all students to track their
applications) to ease both recruiters and students.
